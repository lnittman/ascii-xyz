# Integration Status Assessment

## Overall Integration Health
- Apps share common packages via workspace dependencies, ensuring version alignment.
- Data primarily flows through the database package with additional communication via webhooks, AI services, and the new `api` backend.
- Integration architecture remains straightforward without circular dependencies.
- The `security` package is now integrated in `app` and `api`.
- The `logger` package is used by `api` and `app` for structured console output while `ai` continues with Mastra's logger.
- Core packages now include unit tests to verify integration helpers.

## App-to-App Integration

### app ↔ ai
- The `app` application calls AI agents via API endpoints configured in the next-config package.
- Shared environment variables define the AI service URL.
- Integration quality is moderate; lacks explicit error handling for AI failures.
- No recent changes in communication patterns.

### api ↔ app
- The `api` service exposes routes consumed by the main `app` via fetch requests.
- Currently used for health checks and triggering model sync tasks.

### api ↔ ai
- Cron jobs in `api` invoke AI agents to summarise scraped data.
- Integration health is early stage but functional.

## App-to-Package Integration

### app → database
- Uses Prisma client extensively in server actions.
- Strong coupling ensures consistent models but requires database availability.

### app → design
- Consumes UI components and providers throughout the frontend.
- Integration is seamless; components are imported directly.

### ai → next-config
- Reads runtime configuration from next-config `keys.ts`.
- Provides consistent environment variable validation across services.

## Package-to-Package Integration

### auth → design
- AuthProvider from auth package wrapped inside DesignSystemProvider to share theming.
- Low coupling with clear API boundaries.

### webhooks → auth
- Webhook helpers import `auth` to retrieve organization context before sending events.
- Integration works but lacks comprehensive error handling.

## Integration Pattern Analysis

### Common Patterns
- Environment variable validation using `@t3-oss/env-nextjs` across packages.
- Shared TypeScript configs unify compiler options.
- Providers wrap applications to supply context (Auth, Theme, Analytics).

### Anti-Patterns
- A few packages still lack tests, reducing integration reliability.
- Lack of centralized documentation for environment variables.
- Occasional direct imports between apps could lead to tighter coupling.

## Data Flow Mapping
- User requests hit the `app` Next.js frontend which queries the database and may trigger webhooks or AI agents.
- Analytics events captured client-side are sent to PostHog.

## Integration Recommendations
1. Improve error handling when the `app` communicates with AI agents.
   - **Current State**: Network failures bubble up to the client.
   - **Target State**: Graceful fallbacks with user-friendly messages.
   - **Suggested Approach**: Wrap agent calls in try/catch blocks and log errors.
   - **Status**: Chat route now logs failures and returns friendly errors (2025-06-19).
2. Document environment variables required for each integration.
   - **Current State**: Spread across multiple `keys.ts` files.
   - **Target State**: Single doc summarizing all required env vars.
   - **Suggested Approach**: Create a new page under `docs/` referencing each package.
   - **Status**: Completed. See [environment-variables.md](environment-variables.md).
3. Establish integration test coverage.
   - **Current State**: Minimal tests for cross-package behaviour.
   - **Target State**: Cron routes and core flows verified by Vitest.
   - **Status**: Cron auth, cron success, tasks auth, tasks success, Clerk webhook, verify API key, database client singleton, share list, and share token tests added.
- Logger package adopted in `ai` service for consistent output.
- Improved error handling in `api` when contacting AI agents.
