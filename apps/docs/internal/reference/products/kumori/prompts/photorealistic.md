# Photorealistic Prompt Guide

## Overview

Photorealistic image generation aims to create images indistinguishable from actual photographs. This guide covers techniques for achieving stunning realism through careful prompt construction, focusing on lighting, materials, camera settings, and environmental details.

## Core Principles

### Essential Elements
- **Accurate Proportions**: True-to-life human and object proportions
- **Natural Lighting**: Realistic light behavior and shadows
- **Material Properties**: Accurate surface textures and reflections
- **Depth of Field**: Camera-accurate focus and bokeh
- **Environmental Context**: Believable settings and atmospherics

### Key Keywords
- **Primary**: photorealistic, photography, realistic, photo
- **Camera**: DSLR photo, 85mm lens, professional photography
- **Quality**: high resolution, 8K, ultra detailed, hyperrealistic

## Prompt Structure

### Basic Template
```
[camera setup], [subject description], [pose/action], [clothing/details], 
[lighting setup], [environment], [technical specifications], photorealistic
```

### Professional Photography Template
```
[focal length] photography of [subject], shot with [camera], 
[lighting type], [composition], [post-processing style], 
[atmosphere], professional photography
```

## Camera and Lens Settings

### Focal Lengths and Their Effects

#### Portrait (85mm-135mm)
