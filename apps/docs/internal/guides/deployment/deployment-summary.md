# Deployment Summary

## Changes in arbor-xyz (Main App)

### Performance Optimizations
- Fixed infinite loop issue causing server crashes
- Reduced aggressive polling in `useChatMessages` hook (removed 5s interval)
- Increased deduping interval from 2s to 30s
- Removed excessive cache revalidation in `updateChatModel`
- Added conditional debug logging with `DEBUG_MESSAGES` env var

### Service Integration
- Refactored to use centralized Mastra client from `@repo/mastra`
- Removed all manual fetch calls to AI service endpoints
- Created proper domain services wrapping Mastra client
- Standardized resourceId usage to always use `user.clerkId`

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed content substring error when content is an array (AI SDK v3 format)
- Added proper type checking before string operations
- Fixed model update loop with `modelUpdateInProgressRef`

## Deployment Steps for arbor-xyz

1. **Environment Variables** - Ensure these are set in Vercel:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_URL=https://your-mastra-cloud-url
   MASTRA_KEY=your-mastra-api-key (if using production)
   DEBUG_MESSAGES=false (for production)
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: optimize chat performance and fix infinite loop issues

   - Remove aggressive polling and reduce cache revalidation
   - Fix content type errors and model update loops
   - Integrate centralized Mastra client
   - Add conditional debug logging"
   
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Verify in Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Check build logs for any errors
   - Ensure environment variables are properly set
   - Monitor for any runtime errors

## Changes in apps/ai (AI Service)

### Structure Reorganization
- Moved all attachment-related code to `src/mastra/lib/attachments/`
- Removed non-standard directories (`src/api`, `src/embeddings`, `src/services`, `src/workers`)
- Aligned with Mastra conventions (single `src/mastra/` directory)

### Features
- Chat agent with memory and tool support
- Code agent for programming assistance
- Summarizer agent for content summarization
- Attachment search with RAG capabilities
- MCP tool integration

## Deployment Steps for apps/ai

1. **Environment Variables** - Create `.env.local`:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your-postgres-url
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-key
   MAIN_APP_URL=https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app
   ```

2. **Deploy to Mastra Cloud**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: reorganize structure for Mastra Cloud deployment

   - Move attachment code to mastra/lib directory
   - Remove non-standard directories
   - Align with Mastra conventions"
   
   git push origin main
   
   # Deploy to Mastra Cloud
   pnpm mastra deploy
   ```

3. **Post-Deployment**:
   - Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_URL` in arbor-xyz to point to Mastra Cloud URL
   - Test the connection between services
   - Monitor logs for any issues
