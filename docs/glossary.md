# ASCII Platform Glossary

Key terms and concepts used throughout the ASCII platform documentation.

## Core Concepts

### ASCII Art
Text-based visual art using characters from the ASCII character set to create images, patterns, and designs. Our platform reimagines this classic art form for the AI era.

### Frame
A single static ASCII art image. Multiple frames can be combined to create animations.

### Generation
The process of creating ASCII art through AI collaboration, transforming text prompts or images into character-based artwork.

### Gallery
A curated collection of ASCII artworks, either personal (user's own creations) or public (community shared).

### Prompt
A text description that guides the AI in generating ASCII artwork. The bridge between human imagination and AI creation.

## User Concepts

### Creator
Someone who generates ASCII art using the platform, whether for artistic expression, nostalgia, or creative exploration.

### Artwork
A complete ASCII creation, which may consist of single or multiple frames, along with its metadata and generation context.

### Visibility
The sharing state of an artwork - either private (creator only) or public (community accessible).

### Collection
A themed grouping of ASCII artworks, allowing for organization and curation.

## Creative Concepts

### Style Transfer
Applying artistic styles or aesthetic qualities to ASCII generation while maintaining character-based constraints.

### Animation Loop
A sequence of ASCII frames that creates motion when displayed in succession.

### Density
The visual weight of ASCII art - how sparse or dense the character placement appears.

### Character Palette
The specific set of ASCII characters used in a generation (e.g., using only specific symbols for different effects).

## Interaction Concepts

### Magic Moment
The instant when a user first sees their text prompt transformed into ASCII art - the core delight of the platform.

### Iteration
The process of refining ASCII art through successive generations with adjusted prompts.

### Remix
Taking existing ASCII art as inspiration for new creations, building on community creativity.

### Share Link
A unique URL that allows anyone to view a specific ASCII artwork, even without an account.

## Platform Concepts

### BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)
The ability for users to provide their own AI model API keys for generation, giving them control over their AI provider.

### Generation Credit
Abstract unit of value for creating ASCII art (implementation-agnostic).

### Community Gallery
The collective space where public ASCII artworks are discovered and appreciated.

### Export Format
Various ways to save and share ASCII art - as text, image, or data structure.

## Philosophy Terms

### Nostalgic Computing
The emotional connection to early computer aesthetics and text-based interfaces.

### Constraint Creativity
Finding artistic expression within the limitations of ASCII characters.

### Democratic Art
Making creative tools accessible to everyone, regardless of artistic skill.

### Textual Canvas
Viewing text characters as a medium for visual expression.
