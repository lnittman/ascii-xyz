# User Journeys

## The First-Time Creator

### Discovery Moment
Sarah sees ASCII art shared in a message. She's curious—how was this made? A link brings her to our platform. No signup wall. No tutorial. Just a prompt field and gentle invitation: "Describe what you want to create."

### Magic Moment
She types "cat sleeping in the sun" and presses enter. In seconds, ASCII art appears. Not perfect, but undeniably a cat, undeniably charming. She didn't expect it to work. It did.

### Hook Formation
She tries another: "city skyline at night." Then another. Each generation takes seconds. Each surprises. She's not thinking about the technology—she's thinking about what to create next.

### Value Realization
She copies her favorite and pastes it into a message to a friend. It works perfectly. No image hosting, no file sending. Just characters. The friend is delighted. Sarah is hooked.

## The Regular Creator

### Morning Ritual
Alex opens the platform like opening a sketchbook. Today's mood: "rainy day at a coffee shop." The ASCII art captures something words couldn't. It becomes their status message.

### Creative Sessions
Weekend mornings are for experimentation. Alex has discovered:
- Certain prompts yield better results
- Animation brings ASCII to life
- Collections organize their growing gallery

### Sharing Habits
Alex shares differently:
- Daily creations go to close friends
- Special pieces go public
- Animations get saved for perfect moments

### Identity Formation
Alex is becoming known as "the ASCII person" in their circles. It's become part of their digital identity. They don't just use the platform—they're part of its community.

## The Community Explorer

### Gallery Wandering
Jordan doesn't create much. They browse. The public gallery is their museum. They discover artists, styles, techniques. They favorite pieces that resonate.

### Inspiration Gathering
Seeing others' work sparks ideas:
- "I didn't know ASCII could do that"
- "This prompt approach is clever"
- "I want to try this style"

### Social Discovery
Jordan follows creators whose work consistently surprises. They watch for new pieces. They share discoveries. They're a curator, not creator, and that's valued.

### Occasional Creation
Inspired by something seen, Jordan occasionally creates. Not often, but meaningfully. Their creations are responses, remixes, conversations with other art.

## The Professional Integrator

### Business Context

### Integration Points
Sam uses ASCII art professionally:
- Email signatures that stand out
- Presentation slides that surprise
- Documentation that delights
- Marketing that differentiates

### Client Reactions
Clients don't expect ASCII art in proposals. That's exactly why it works. It shows creativity, technical literacy, and attention to detail. It starts conversations.

### Efficiency Gains
What used to require a designer now takes seconds. Need an illustration for a blog post? Generate it. Need a visual for a slide? Create it. ASCII art becomes a secret weapon.
