# Design Principles

## 1. Invisible Until Needed

The interface disappears when creating. No chrome, no distractions, no unnecessary elements competing for attention. The ASCII art is the hero. Tools and controls reveal themselves only at the moment of intent.

Like a well-designed terminal, we show only what matters in the moment.

## 2. Instant Gratification

The magic happens immediately. No loading screens, no progress bars that break the creative flow. The moment between imagination and creation should feel instantaneous.

Speed is a feature. Waiting kills creativity.

## 3. Familiar Yet Surprising

We use patterns people already know—text inputs, simple commands, copy-paste mechanics—but deliver unexpected delight. The familiar becomes magical when it produces ASCII art.

Terminal aesthetics meet modern sensibilities.

## 4. Constraint as Canvas

We don't hide the grid. We don't pretend ASCII isn't limited. We celebrate the constraint, making it visible and beautiful. The character grid isn't a limitation—it's the medium.

Like Teenage Engineering's OP-1, we make constraints playful.

## 5. Monospace as Monument

Fixed-width fonts aren't a technical requirement—they're an aesthetic choice. Every character gets equal space, equal importance. Democracy in typography.

We honor the monospace tradition while making it beautiful.

## 6. Progressive Disclosure

Start with a prompt. That's it.

Advanced features exist but don't announce themselves. Density controls, animation speeds, character palettes—all available for those who seek them, invisible to those who don't.

Complexity on demand, simplicity by default.

## 7. Copy-Paste Culture

ASCII art's superpower is its portability. Every interaction should reinforce this. One-click copying. Clear selection states. Obvious sharing mechanisms.

We design for the moment someone wants to share their creation with the world.

## 8. Dark by Default

ASCII art was born in the glow of CRT monitors. Green on black. Amber on darkness. We honor that heritage with dark interfaces that make the art glow.

Light mode exists, but darkness is home.

## 9. Emotional Physics

Interactions should feel physical, tangible, satisfying. Generating art should feel like pressing a satisfying button. Frames should flip like cards. Animations should breathe.

Digital interactions with analog satisfaction.

## 10. Respect the Rectangle

ASCII art lives in rectangles. We don't fight this—we embrace it. Our layouts honor the rectangular nature of text. Cards, frames, boundaries—all celebrating the shape of our medium.

## Visual Philosophy

### Color: Restrained Radiance
- Text is the hero, color is the supporting cast
- System colors that adapt to context
- Semantic meaning over decorative choice

### Space: Purposeful Emptiness
- Empty space is active, not passive
- Breathing room for art to live
- Inspired by Kenya Hara's "emptiness"

### Motion: Meaningful Movement
- Animation with purpose, not decoration
- State changes that tell stories
- Inspired by early terminal phosphor trails

### Typography: Monospace Monumentalism
- Fixed-width as a design choice, not limitation
- Size creates hierarchy
- Weight creates emphasis

## Interaction Principles

### Input: Prompt as Performance
The prompt input is our primary instrument. It should feel:
- Immediate and responsive
- Powerful yet simple
- Like a command line for creativity

### Output: Revelation Ritual
Generating ASCII art should feel ceremonious:
- A moment of anticipation
- A reveal that delights
- A result worth sharing

### Navigation: Wayfinding Without Words
- Visual hierarchy guides without labels
- Muscle memory over menu hunting
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users

## The ASCII Aesthetic

We're not recreating terminal emulators. We're not making retro for retro's sake. We're taking the best of ASCII's heritage—its simplicity, universality, and charm—and bringing it forward.

Modern tools. Timeless art. Beautiful constraints.
